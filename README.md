# Vue.js HackerNews clone

[Live demo](http://yyx990803.github.io/vue-hackernews/)

Built with [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org) and the official [HackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API), with routing, comments, comment folding, user profile & realtime updates.

The build setup uses Webpack and the [Vue Loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) plugin, which enables Vue components to be written in a format that encapsulates a component's style, template and logic in a single file.

### Building

``` bash
npm install
# watch:
npm run dev
# build:
npm run build
```
